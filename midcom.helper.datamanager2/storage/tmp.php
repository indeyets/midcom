/**
 * Datamanager 2 Data storage implementation: Temporary storage object.
 *
 * This class is aimed to provide a dummy storage object, used as intermediate backend between
 * nullstorage based creations and final save operations if and only if attachments or parameters
 * are set outside the scope of regular storage operations.
 * Usually, you won't save datamanagers running with this storage backend, accessing the types
 * values directly. The types' convert_to_xxx helper functions can be a nice help if you need
 * string representations. This type is usually only used with the creation controller.
 *
 * This class is a specialization of the null storage backend with a pre-initialized $object
 * member.
