/**
 * Datamanager 2 Widget base class.
 *
 * As with all subclasses, the actual initialization is done in the initialize() function,
 * not in the constructor, to allow for error handling.
 *
 * Quick glance at the changes
 *
 * - No more form prefixes, use the field name as a form field name
 * - Now uses class members, which should use initializers (var $name = 'default_value';)
 *   for configuration defaults.
 * - The schema configuration ('widget_config') is merged using the semantics
 *   $widget->$key = $value;
