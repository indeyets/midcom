  - The change username form now changes its names/headings when
    the E-Mail is used as username.

  + Added username->email synchronization which uses only emails
    as usernames. Note, that there is no reverse sync from the
    email field into the username field (yet).
  - Made the URL of the account activated screen configurable
    using a HTTP request arg. (Useful to send users back from
    where they accessed the account registration.)
  + The config option register_allow_types can now be used to
    limit the account types that are open for registration. This
    is independant of the account definitons.
