  * NAP does now add a .html to all leaves to yield nicer
    URLs.
  * Implemented "Public Publisihng" allowing you to build
    things like a guestbook. It requires credencials in the
    config, which will require some manual access privileges
    tuning inside the topic tree. Basically this allows 
    things like guestbooks.

2004-04-15  Nico Kaiser
  * "RSS enable" config option was not saved. Fixed.

2004-04-14  Nico Kaiser

    (closes #0000624)

2003-12-04  Nico Kaiser
  * Changed list_leaves behaviour, it's now more like the index
    page list

2003-11-17  Nico Kaiser
  * Added UTF-8 encoding and special characters entities for RSS 
    export (should be more valid now)

2003-11-07  Nico Kaiser
  * The article names changed again from timestamp to
    "yyyy-mm-dd-###" where ### is the per-day number
  ! rewrote the configuration system, it's now like in the other
    components (remember to adjust your sitegroup-local config and
    don't include the config snippet anymore, this is done
    automatically now!)
  - The default templates / schemas don't use htmlfilter anymore
    but the WYSIWYG htmlarea

2003-11-06  Nico Kaiser

    little bit to match the new (in-development) MidCOM layout

2003-08-07
  * Implemented PAGETITLE setter method. The articles title field 
    is used for the page title. The topic's extra field is used 
    for the indexes.

2003-07-18
  * Fixed a bug in the URL Handler which wasn't stict enough. (URLs
    like .../create/images/css/point.gif would cause the creation
    of a new article, this could happen if you copy-paste CSS-styled
    list-items with custom image as list item.)

2003-06-27
  * Did some localization

2003-06-13
  * Integrated /latest/x and /rss/x patches
