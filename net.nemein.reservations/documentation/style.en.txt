Viewing resources
-----------------

### Resource list

Resource list starts with `<(view-list-header)>`.

For each different resource type there will be a `<(view-type-header)>`. Each time the resource type changes, elements `<(view-type-footer)>` and `<(view-type-header)>` are displayed.

If the resource type stays unchanged, each resource will be shown with the element `<(view-list-resource)>`.

Listing ends with `<(view-type-footer)>` and finally with `<(view-list-footer)>`.

### Resource view

The requested resource will be displayed with the following style elements:

1. `<(view-resource-header)>`
2. `<(view-resource-calendar)>`
3. `<(view-resource-footer)>`

If the folder is configured to enable multiple calendars for comparison, each requested resource will be shown with the three style elements described above. After them there will be a `<(view-resource-list)>`, which will conclude the view.

### Administrative interfaces

* Creating a resource
  - `<(view-resource-create)>`.
* Editing a resource
  - `<(view-resource-edit)>`
* Deleting a resource
  - `<(view-resource-delete)>`
  
Viewing reservations
--------------------

A single reservation will be displayed with style element `<(view-reservation)>`.

Reservations list will start with a `<(view-datereservations-title)>`. If there are no reservations for the requested time span, `<(view-datereservations-noevents)>` will be displayed.

Each day will start with a `<(view-datereservations-header)>`. Each event for the day is shown with a `<(view-datereservations-item)>` and the day ends with a `<(view-datereservations-footer)>`.

### Reservation actions

* Create a new reservation
  - `<(view-reservation-create)>`
* Edit a reservation
  - `<(view-reservation-edit)>`
* Delete a reservation
  - `<(view-reservation-delete)>`
* Reservation repeat handler
