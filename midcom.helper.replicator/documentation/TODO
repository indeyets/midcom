## Stopping replication loops

In 2-way many-to-many or one-to-one there is a significant risk of looping: When you import an object its watchers will be called (to propagate the replication onwards), and this would cause it also to be replicated back to where it came from.

We need some way to prevent replicating change that we import back to its originators (which may be a long chain in some cases).

Idea: Compare item's metadata.revision in DB to the one in XML, and then use that as a check whether we need to import the item.
