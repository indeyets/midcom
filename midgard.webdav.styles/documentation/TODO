-get authentication to acutally authenticate
-fix index handler
-make /midcoms/componentname display the default style elements
-support for renaming files
-escape forward slash in Style names

Long term: 
-it would be nice if the component could display inherited style elements somehow
-it would even be nicer if it worked with snippets and page elements as well 
(maybe even articles?)
