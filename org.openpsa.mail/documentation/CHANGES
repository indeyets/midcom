2006-06-30 rambo
  - cleaned line endings in files
  - more robust error handling in mime_decode()
  - added extra sanity check to mime boundary (for example single quotes
    inside the boundary choke mail_mimedecode() since it has a bug in its
    header parsing), we fix the boundary if it would break mail_mimedecode.
  - some code cleanup
  - version bump for packaging
