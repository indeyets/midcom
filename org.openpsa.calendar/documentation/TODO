org.openpsa.calendar TODO
=========================

## Datamanager 2 migration

* o.o.calendar should be converted to use Datamanager 2 for event editing and
  rendering instead of Datamanager 1
* Datamanager 2 would provide the new universalchooser widget for selecting
  event participants, supporting person creation

## On-demand handlers migration

* `viewer.php` should be split into different handler classes for calendar list
  views, event editing, etc

## Tagging

* Support for tagging events
* Transmit event's tags also to event note wiki pages
* Enable setting colors for tags, using color of event's first tag in the views

## Calendar subscription

* Subscribing to remote iCalendars via HTTP GET request
* Multiple calendar subscriptions possible per person
* Default tags and privacy settings per subscription
* Updating manually and via cron
* Subscribed events are read-only
* iCal Events WordPress plugin may have useful code for this
* Utilize helpers for HTTP fetching from org.openpsa.httplib

## Reminders

* Register midcom.services.at processes for firing event reminders
  some time before event
* Use org.openpsa.notifications for reminder sending to allow multiple
  formats like Growl, SMS, Email and Jabber

## Travel support and time zones

* Different event schema including From and To (fields that recognize airport
  codes, city names etc)
* Recognize time zones for the From and To locations to enable inputting
  times in local time (to aid entering flights)
* Generally utilize org.routamc.positioning to determine user's local time zone,
  and display times accordingly (this should probably be handled in MidCOM
  core level actually)
