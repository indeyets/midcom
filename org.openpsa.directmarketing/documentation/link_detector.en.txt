OpenPSA Link Detector
=====================

The `link_detector.php` script is used to track the specially formatted
links that a user follows from an HTML email message or a normal HTML page.
The link detector script acts as a general forwarding mechanism that logs
all links traversals through it.

The script takes two HTTP GET parameters:

    .../link_detector.php?token=TOKEN&link=LINK

The `token` parameter contains the opaque token associated with the
link source document (either an email message or a normal HTML page).
The 'link' parameter contains the full HTTP URI that the user is about
to open.

In addition to the GET parameters, the script uses two environment variables
for configuration. The 'logger' variable contains the URI of the link log file
or the web resource used for logging the link traversal. If a logger has
not been configured, then link traversals are logged to the standard error log.
The optional `domains` variable can be used to restrict redirects to a
comma-separated list of domains.

The link detector script responds with a temporary redirect message
pointing to the given link URI. The detector script then logs the link
traversal to the given logger URI. If the logger is a file URI, then
the token, a space, and the link URI are appended to the referenced
file as a new line. If the logger is a HTTP URI, then a POST request
containing the token as the `token` argument and the link URI as the
`link` argument is made to that URI.

If the `domains` parameter is given and the domain part of the link URI
does not end with any of the configured domains, then the script simply
responds with a `403 Forbidden` response.

Apache configuration
--------------------

The minimum configuration for the link detector script `link_detector.php`
is to just place it in a publicly visible directory and set the `logger`
environment variable. In this case the `link_detector_address` configuration
option should simply be set to something like this:

    http://example.com/link_detector.php?token=TOKEN&link=

where the logger part is the URI of the link traversal logger. The
directmarketing component will replace the `TOKEN` string with the
message specific token and append the real link URI to the end of the
configured address.

It is possible to use the `mod_rewrite` module to achieve prettier link
addresses. For example:

    RewriteRule ^/(.*)/(.*) link_detector.php?token=$1&link=$2

With such a mapping the `link_detector_address` configuration option can
be set to the following:

    http://example.com/TOKEN/

The `logger` and `domains` environment variables can be set using the
Apache `SetEnv` directive:

    SetEnv logger file:///var/log/link.log
    SetEnv domains example.com,example.fi
