  - (Tarjei) Added support for not showing the indexarticles in the 
    sitemap. By default turned on.

  - The Pagetitle now reverts to the name given to the topic, which seems more
    logical to me.

    change

    there is no l10n.

2003-06-13
  - Introduced this new component, it creates an simple tree of your
    site and has basic configuration options. The styling logic should
    allow extensive customization.
