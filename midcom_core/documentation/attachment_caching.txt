MidCOM 3 supports attachment caching. Basically it means that attachments can be served without MidCOM 3's intervention.

Usage:
Add following lines to the default configuration

enable_attachment_cache: true
attachment_handler: midcom_core_helpers_attachment
attachment_cache_url: http://myimageserver.com/blobs/
attachment_cache_directory: /path/to/the/directory/accessible/by/webserver/blobs/

Basically attachments can be served from totally different server.

If you want to serve your attachments from some content delivery network it will require you to write your own attachment handler. You need to implement interface that has been defined in MidCOM 
3's default attachment_handler

Interface requires that you implement functions for putting and removing attachments and some function that returns the URL of the attachment.
