  - Filesystem conversion

2004-09-20 torben

2004-07-03
  - NAP code now tries to find a suitable nav_name in more cases, 
    the article's name is now used as a default if the title is
    empty. midcom will still default to the url if both title and
    name are empty though. This fixes #13.

2004-07-02

    URLs

    not in autoindex mode.

2004-06-28
  - htmlentities replaced by htmlspecialchars

2004-06-22
  - NAV_VISIBLE set to false if no topicindex is available (which would
