    Good for frontpages etc. Usage: $midcom->dynamic_load("/path/to/dir/upcoming/5");

  - Fixed Bug #447 (active leaf not set)
  ! Changed default layout to utilize HTML WYSIWYG Editor (example)
  ! Reworked the components configuration mechanism to a more user
    friendly way. There are now dropdowns that let you choose schemas
    or sort orders. Renamed every occurence of "layout" to "schema".
    This change breaks backwards compatiblity against existing topics.
  - Fixed a bug, that displayed all expired articles in the NAP data
  + Articles with an empty sorting timestamp will now be displayed
    always at the top of the list.
  - Added Substyle selection depending on choosen schema (as defined in 
    the configuration, not on an per-article basis)
  - Rewrote a field descriptor in the Admin UI
  - Admin UI referenced fields from the default layout, this is bad.
    Removed.
  - Fixed a bug inside the update preferences code that might lead to
    errors during update when a unset preference is set to the site
    default. The code was trying to unset an not existing parameter.
  - de.linkm.events does now feature an /lates/x syntax displaying
    the latest x events, events without a date will be omitted in
    this mode.
