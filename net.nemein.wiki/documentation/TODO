====================

## Namespaces

* Namespaces implemented as topic tree
  - Created subtopics tagged with a parameter identifying the
    root level wiki topic
  - WikiLink as default points to current topic (==namespace)
    - to point to another namespace prepend with /name/space/wikiword
  - WikiWord matchers should strip away slashes (/) from wikiword string
    if the string does not begin with slash
    - This means "/name/space/wikiword" is valid but "something/other" is not
    - Calendar meeting note wikiword generator that generates wikiwords like
      "/calendar/2006/From event 'STT / foobar'" must have the string 
      'STT / foobar' replaced with 'STT - foobar' before presenting it to the
      wiki component

## InterWiki links

* Implement InterWiki linking as per the InterWikiMap spec
  - Should replace the current [wiki: ] WikiPedia linking format

## Tagging

* Display contexts in slightly different format in the different ends of the tag
  - "this page is "new-feature" of "Midgard 1.8"
  - "pages tagged as "new-feature" for this page"
