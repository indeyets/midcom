/**
 * This class encaspulates a the information contained in a component manifest.
 * Naturally, its information is read-only.
 *
 * <b>The Component Manifest</b>
 *
 * The Manifest contains all necessary information to deal with a component without
 * actually having to load them. Originally, all of this information has been included
 * in the component interface class itself, but this provides to be a rather slow
 * alternative. See the <i>History</i> Section below for further information about this
 * background.
 *
 * The component manifest on-disk actually consists of a relatively simple accociative
 * array which describes the component. The following example shows an average manifest
 * using all available options and should serve us as an example:
 *
 * <code>
 * 'name' => 'net.nehmer.static',
 * 'purecode' => false,
 * 'version' => 15,
 * 'privileges' => Array
 * (
 *     'read' => MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW,
 *     'write' => Array (MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_DENY, MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW)
 * ),
 * 'class_definitions' => Array ('my_classes.inc'),
 * 'watches' => Array
 * (
 *     Array
 *     (
 *         'classes' => null,
 *         'operations' => MIDCOM_OPERATION_DBA_UPDATE,
 *     ),
 *     Array
 *     (
 *         'classes' => Array
 *             (
 *                 'midcom_baseclasses_database_article',
 *                 'midcom_baseclasses_database_topic',
 *             ),
 *         'operations' =>
 *               MIDCOM_OPERATION_DBA_CREATE
 *             | MIDCOM_OPERATION_DBA_DELETE,
 *     ),
 * ),
 * 'customdata' => Array
 * (
 *     'componentname' => $config_array
 * ),
 * </code>
 *
 * As you can see, most of these settings mainly match the configuration options you
 * alredy know from the component interface base class. The information located in this
 * manifest is now used to configure those interface classes automatically, you do not
 * have to manage this information twice.
 *
 * All keys except 'name' are purely optional.
 *
 * <i>string name</i> should be clear, it is the full name of the component.
 *
 * <i>bool purecode</i> is equally easy, indicating whether this is a library or a full
 * scale component.
 *
 * <i>int version</i> is the internal version number of the interface. This value is
 * currently unused in MidCOM context but can be used by your component to manage automatic
 * data storage upgrades.
 *
 * <i>Array privileges</i> is a more complex thing. It contains the full list of all privileges
 * defined by the component. They are propagated to the ACL service during system startup.
 * You have to add only the local keys, the component prefix is
 * added automatically when the information is registered.
 *
 * This array is an accociative one, indexing permission names and their
 * default values. Simple string values are required for the permission
 * names, they must validate against the regular expression <i>/[a-z0-9]+/</i>.
 *
 * So, if you want to add {$component}:read with a default value of
 * MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW you would do something like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $this->_acl_privileges['read'] => MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW;
 * </pre>
 *
 * This assumes, that object owners should get no specific treatment, e.g.
 * that the owner privilege set inherits its value from the content object
 * parent. In case you want to explicitly set a distinct value for an
 * object owner, you must pass an array to this function:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $this->_acl_privileges['write'] => Array
 * (
 *     MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_DENY, // default privilege value
 *     MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW // owner default privilege value
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this case the definition grants object owners the defined privilege. The
 * only way this can be overriden now is having the privilege denied to the
 * accessing user directly (e.g. a person privilege).
 *
 * Note, that it is often sensible to do something like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $this->_acl_privileges['read'] => Array
 * (
 *     MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW, // default privilege value
 *     MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW // owner default privilege value
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * That way, object owners can read the object, even if the read access is
 * prohibited for a users group for example. Without the explicit
 * user default specification it would get inherited from there.
 *
 * So, if you take the very first example from abvoe again (the one without
 * the Array), it is read by MidCOM as if you would have specified this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $this->_acl_privileges['read'] => Array
 * (
 *     MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW, // default privilege value
 *     MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_INHERIT // owner default privilege value
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note, that INHERIT does not INHERIT from the system default privilege but
 * from the <i>immediate parent</i>.
 *
 * <i>Array class_definitions</i> contains a list of class definition files of the classes
 * the component makes available to the framework. Their intermediate classes are loaded
 * during startup, and the component is loaded dynamically whenever the final DBA
 * implemetation is needed.
 *
 * <i>Array watches</i> is a special thing. It allows your component to specify that
 * it wants to "observe" all operations of a certain type on DBA objects. Such a watch
 * declaration consists of two keys, <i>classes</i> and <i>operation</i>. Classes defines
 * for which DBA types (you need to specify the direct DBA types here, not any decendants)
 * you want to watch operations, null indicates an unlimited watch. The operation key
 * then, obviously, specifies the operation(s) you want to watch, which is a bitfield
 * consisting of MIDCOM_OPERATION_xxx flags.
 *
 * <i>Array customdata</i> is the run-of-the-mill extension place of the system. It lets
 * you place arbitrary arrays indexed by components (like 'midcom.serivces.cron' or
 * 'midcom.admin.aegir') into it along with meta-information relevant to that component
 * only. This is used to extend the information available through the context. No key
 * in here is mandatory, the default is an empty array.
 *
 * <b>Loading a Component Manifest based on a file on disk</b>
 *
 * The class is always intialized using a component name. It will load the components'
 * manifest from disk, executing any post-processing necessary at that point (like
 * the completion of the privilege names).
 *
 * Usually you should not have to bother with this, as it is managed by the component
 * loader.
 *
 * Be aware, that you must ensure the correctness of the manifest you provide. For
 * performance reasons it is not validated during runtime.
 *
 * <b>Caching</b>
 *
 * The component loader does now maintain a simple cached script which loads the manifests
 * of all installed components. The manifest information themselves are thus not subject
 * to caching, only the list of components.
 *
 * So, essentially, you need to invalidate the MidCOM cache whenever you remove or install
 * components.
 *
 *
 * <b>History</b>
 *
 * Originally, MidCOM did retrieve all necessary information about a component by using
 * the main Component Interface Class, nowadays this is usually a subclass of
 * midcom_baseclasses_components_interface. While this was certainly an easy solution,
 * especially in the beginning where not much information was related to the component,
 * it proved to be anything but scalable.
 *
 * By the time of the implementation of this manifest, many places of the system (particular
 * DBA and ACL) requires all components to be loaded to have access to class names,
 * defined ACL privileges and similar things. This was rather time consuming and unnecessary.
 * Hence the Manifest was introduced to be able to handle components without actually loading
 * their interfaces.
