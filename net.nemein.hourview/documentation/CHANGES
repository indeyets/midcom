  + Fixed bug on wrong lists of approved hours getting sent

2005-05-30 bergie
  + Hiding numerous PHP notices from OpenPSA 1.x

2005-05-20 bergie
  + The component should now fail gracefully also in the event that OpenPSA
    older than 1.12.0 is installed (because nemein_net array is not in
    global context)

2005-05-17 bergie
  + Now the component initialization will fail if OpenPSA is not installed

2005-05-12 bergie
  + Made this component actually functional. It allows user to
    see hour reports in Projects where they are marked as client
    and approve them. When approved, email will be sent to project
    manager
