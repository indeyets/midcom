Navigation order
================

It is possible to arrange navigational elements to some extent. All of the folders are sortable and depending on the type of the folder its content might also offer the sorting feature.

E.g. the most commonly used folder type, _Regular content_ (_net.nehmer.static_), is sortable.

You can choose the preferred order of items from the dropdown list and arrange the items by dragging and dropping them to their places.

Finally click on the _Save_ button.
