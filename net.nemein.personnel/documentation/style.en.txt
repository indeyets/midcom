===========================

Showing alphabetically sorted or flat organized personnel
---------------------------------------------------------

Listing will start with a <(show-index-header)> element. Each row will be started with a <(show-index-row-header)>, continued by configured amount of <(show-index-item)> elements on a row, each showing index details of one person.

When the column count reaches configured limit (configuration key `persons_in_row`) <(show-index-row-footer)> will close the row and a new <(show-index-row-header)> will be displayed (if applicable).

If a row is missing columns, each of the missing columns will be filled with a <(show-index-item-empty)> element.

Showing phase is concluded with an element <(show-index-footer)>.

If there are no persons to show, style element <(show-index-empty)> will be displayed instead of any of the elements above.


Showing sub grouped personnel
-----------------------------

For historical reasons showing grouped personnel will include headers and footers for rows and place empty style elements to fill in the missing table cells.

Showing grouped personnel will start by displaying <(show-grouped-header)>.

For the beginning of each group <(show-group-header)> will be displayed.

For each row a placeholder <(show-group-row-header)> will be shown. Then <(show-group-person)> will be displayed as many times as configured (configuration key `persons_in_row`) and <(show-group-row-footer)> will close the row (placeholder).

If the last row is missing persons (e.g. only 2 out of 6 persons could shown on the last row), each of the empty cells will show a style element <(show-group-empty-cell)> until the row is full and <(show-group-row-footer)> will be displayed, following <(show-group-footer)>, which closes the group.

When each group has been displayed the viewing phase will be concluded with <(show-grouped-footer)>.

Showing selected person
-----------------------

To display the selected person <(show-person)> will be shown.
