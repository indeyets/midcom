org.routamc.photostream TODO
============================

## Data migration

* bundle net.siriux.photos classes required for migration
* better photographer resolve to person
* Check if any wiki pages on the site refer to the images using the
  `[photo: GUID]` format and change the GUID to point to the
  org_routamc_photostream_photo objects

## EXIF handling

* Figure out what to do with timezones
* Try to recognize invidual cameras (and use that info to recognize photographer)

## Flickr synchronization

* Enable synchronizing user's photos between Midgard and Flickr

## Email integration

* Enable reading in emailed photos, like in net.nehmer.blog `handler/api/email.php`
  - Generate some password that must exist in email content
  - Alternatively (the simpler way must also be supported for moblogging
    purposes) check email's GPG signature
